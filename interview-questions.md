# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.

  Create

3. When creating a basic (stateless) class component in React, what are the necessary elements needed to render "Hello World" on the page?

  Your answer:
  Without writing out the code completely, we would need AT LEAST the following:
  An import 
  A class 
  A render
  A return
  A set of opening and closing divs
  A text tag like, p, or h1 depending on how youd like it to look. 
  An export
  
  Researched answer:
  .. I dont really have a researched answer. After writing out my answer, I visited multiple websites and found varying answers but (with a few exceptions) mostly all the examples had the above stated elements. 



4. What is JSX?

  Your answer:
  JavaScript XML(Extensible Markup Language)

  Researched answer:
  "JSX stands for JavaScript XML. With React, it's an extension for XML-like code for elements and components"



5. What is the difference between React state and props?

  Your answer:
  React state is used within the same (parent) component only.
  React props can be used across multiple child components from parent components (passing information) in a read-only manner.
  

  Researched answer:
"What's the difference between state and props in React? In a React component, props are variables passed to it by its parent component. State on the other hand is still variables, but directly initialized and managed by the component."


6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer:
 This was only very briefly mentioned a few days ago and from what I heard, it's a bit of bad practice.  However, I've yet to research it until now. 
 tl;dr: idk but imma 'bout to find out :D

  Researched answer:
  "Image result for What is hoisting in JavaScript and why would I use it:
Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution. Inevitably, this means that no matter where functions and variables are declared, they are moved to the top of their scope regardless of whether their scope is global or local."



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

- React lifecycle methods

Constructor()
getDerivedStateFromProps()
shouldComponentUpdate()
Render()
getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()
componentDidMount()
componentDidUpdate()
componentWillUnmount()

- API

Application Programming Interface


- event.preventDefault()


A funtion that will prevent a 'cancelable' default event from happening. Example: A checkbox click event can be stopped completely. 

- DOM events

Document Object Model Events. This is something like a focus/hover, click/touch, drag, input or error. There is 1-metric-ton of diffferent types of events. You'd use the above mentioned function on some of these events.
